            Even small businesses are likely to encounter recurring technical problems that only the most tech-savvy person will be able to solve. Running into such problems is especially hard for companies with a limited number of staff and no designated IT team.
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            Instead of instructing an employee to solve something that’s way beyond his paygrade, outsourcing your business’s IT needs is the most logical and sustainable solution.
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            Your employees will be able to focus on their real tasks and become even more productive where there aren’t technical issues interrupting their work. However, looking for the right IT company in Singapore is easier said than done.

            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            There are multiple factors to keep in mind when considering which from the endless list of IT companies on the island to hire, but we’re here to make things a bit easier for you.
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            Here are 5 things to consider when looking for an IT company for your business’s needs:
            </p>

          </div>

          <div className="font-poppins">
            <h3 className="sm:text-[28px] text-[22px] mt-[40px] mb-[30px] font-bold">1. Proactive Management</h3>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            IT companies everywhere mostly focus on resolving service tickets such as troubleshooting email problems and dealing with busted printers. After all, most of the problems encountered by small businesses fall within these areas.
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            However, if the IT company is proactive enough, it will closely manage your network to reduce the number of service tickets and make sure that the operations of your business don’t get interrupted due to a minor technical problem.
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            Simply put, we recommend going for an IT company that will address the root of the problem to ensure that fewer technical issues will arise in the future.
            </p>
            
          </div>

          <div className="font-poppins">
            <h3 className="sm:text-[28px] text-[22px] mt-[40px] mb-[30px] font-bold">2. Weekend Services</h3>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            This is perhaps one of the top requirements when looking for an IT company. Since technical problems are unpredictable, the IT company that will be hired should be able to respond as soon as possible, regardless of the day and time.
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            For businesses whose working days bleed into the weekend, you might want to look for an IT company that offers their services 7 days a week. In case the network goes down on a weekend, there won’t be any business interruptions if there’s an IT team that can fix it immediately.
            </p>

          <div className="font-poppins">
            <h3 className="sm:text-[28px] text-[22px] mt-[40px] mb-[30px] font-bold">3. Highly Trained Staff</h3>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            It’s also equally important to consider the skills and experience of its team. We strongly recommend going for an IT company that regularly sends its team to different training programs to ensure that everyone’s up to date when it comes to trends in technology.
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            As a business owner, you wouldn’t hire anyone who lacks the skills, especially when you’re under an industry that strives for customer satisfaction, right?
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">

              Singapore Carpet Cleaning
              </Link> were looking for an IT company to resolve a recurring Internet connection problem, they stated that they also checked the credentials of key staff or team leads in every IT company they were considering. That helped them gauge the expertise of their options.
              
            </p>
            
          </div>

          <div className="font-poppins">
            <h3 className="sm:text-[28px] text-[22px] mt-[40px] mb-[30px] font-bold">4. No Long-term Contracts</h3>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            It’s no secret there are some IT companies that will lock small businesses into long-term contracts, mostly spanning from 2 to 3 years.
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            It’s stressful to be obliged to stick to a contract, especially when an IT company under-performs most of the time. Nobody wants to have to repeatedly deal with a faulty server that should’ve already been fixed in the first place.
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            In line with that, we recommend looking for an IT company with month-to-month contracts and an “out clause” of up to 60 days. Before signing any papers, make sure to ask for the length of their contracts.
            </p>
            
          </div>

          <div className="font-poppins">
            <h3 className="sm:text-[28px] text-[22px] mt-[40px] mb-[30px] font-bold">5. Varied Levels of Support</h3>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            If you own a small company that can’t afford to shell out a lot for IT services, then it’s best to look for an IT company that provides different levels of support to accommodate your business’s needs, budget, and requirements.
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            /For businesses that don’t always deal with technology, you might want to look for an IT company that offers one-time services only when needed. This is the more practical option compared to signing a monthly or yearly contract.
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            Anyway, that’s it for our list of factors to consider when looking for an IT company. It’s important that small business owners be made aware of this in order to avoid signing contracts with mediocre IT support companies.
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
