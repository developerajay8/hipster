              Companies choose to outsource software development because of the
              significant cost reduction. Along with this reason, this strategy
              is more about utilising the top engineering talent and most
              effective technologies. Even with these benefits, there is always
              the challenge to ensure that the developers finish your project
              within the timeline.

              It is imperative to get an insight into the outsourcing partner’s
              delivery processes so that you can offer your clients their
              expected high-quality results. You must assign your project leader
              or manager for collaborating with the outsourcing team. Your
              project leader’s primary task is to keep outsourced, especially
              internationally outsourced, projects on budget and track, thus
              ensuring project delivery is done on time. The manager is
              responsible to help the outsource team to understand your business
              goals and plan a project management timeline.

              A project timeline is a sequential or progressive breakdown of all
              the tasks and subtasks that need to be finished to complete any
              project. This timeline marks the beginning and end of your
              project. The project manager or leader is the one who manages the
              project and is accountable to adhere to this timeline.

              You need to create a list of all the tasks and subtasks throughout
              the project planning process till the final delivery. Divide the
              project into both big and small steps. Any task that aids in
              completing the project on time and within the budget should be
              included in the list. At this stage, do not worry about the order
              of the steps that come later.

              After you have compiled a comprehensive list of the steps involved
              in the project, you should estimate the time each step will take
              to complete. Avoid an unrealistic approach and provide your team
              with enough time to finish the task within your overall time
              frame. This step helps you to properly schedule and sequence each
              task to create a project timeline.

              As you map out the steps of the project, you will realize some
              steps can be carried on simultaneously while some cannot begin

              dependent on others. This is precisely why a timeline is so
              important, it is needed to visualize each step and who is
              responsible for each step. You must have defined roles for
              everyone to avoid timing and resource conflicts which might lead
              to delays.

              continue managing your timeline after the project starts. With the

              As an outsourcing company works on satisfying your expectations,
              this is the first and most important tip. You must have a
              calculative approach to set your goals according to the resources
              at hand instead of over expecting. Ensure to conduct thorough
              requirements and cost-benefit analysis before beginning the design
              and development of the software. If you neglect to do so, you are
              setting your customers and yourself up for disappointment.
              Realistic expectations will help you meet your deadlines, keep the
              project running on time and be aligned with your financial
              objectives. This will also reduce pressure on the outsourcing team
              and help you communicate effectively.

              Since the project is yours, the timeline is also yours. Your
              project manager should constantly be involved at every step of the
              project instead of waiting at the other end for the outcome. They
              should be updated about all the developments so that they can
              effectively follow the project timeline. You can divide the
              project into several phases to facilitate reviews of each phase.
              The key to meeting the project timeline is the cooperation between
              your company and the outsourcing team, therefore you must review
              their work and communicate any changes and expectations.

              You must have heard so many people say that communication is
              paramount. It helps everyone to understand what’s going on. The
              project manager should be able to convey what your company needs
              your outsourcing partner to know about, like about your
              organisation, customers and procedures. This will allow your
              outsourcing team to get in sync with you. Lack of clarity by your
              company may give way to scope creep. It means the inclusion of
              additional features or functions of a new product, requirements,
              or work that is unauthorized. By devoting time to unapproved
              tasks, the project team wastes the original time and budget
              assigned to the project and the end product is not what was
              promised. Therefore, define clear communication channels. Avoid
              unmanaged contact between the client and the developer team.

              A kick-off meeting marks the beginning of the project or any phase

              and the project stakeholder, who can either be external or
              internal. It is where the project manager assembles all important
              stakeholders including the sponsor, internal & external customers,
              and different groups who are assigned for the execution of the
              project. This helps to bring everyone to a common understanding.
              This is also a great opportunity to present the stakeholders with
              information to plan for a robust risk evaluation exercise on any
