              There are a lot of applications which remind us about important
              dates, but they don’t have an in-built shop for sending gifts.

              a greeting card through Uber (In limited countries) or flowers
              through selected partners. But the app should allow an individual
              with the option of pre-selecting a gift item for their loved ones

              application.

              A reminder application with the options of gift items would become
              a hit as users want to have multiple options when it comes to
              gifts. Not everyone wants to send a greeting card or flowers. The
              gift option needs to be made more personal and individuals want to
              send out maybe gift cards or even personalized items like mugs,
              photo frames, soft toys, etc. The capabilities of such an
              application can be extended to valentine’s day, Mother’s Day, etc.

              public transportation or a cab and realize it later on. Losing
              property or a personal item causes panic and distress in the

              Another example can be of taking cooking classes, two or more
              people can get together to join similar classes and not be alone
              or feel left out in a big class.

              take part in an activity that interests all of them. But these
              groups communicate within themselves or through a WhatsApp group.

              possibilities of this application are infinite. You can start a
              career counseling group and help people to sort their careers. Or

              group for quitting any bad habits.
