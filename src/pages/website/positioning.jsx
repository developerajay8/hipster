              Positioning starts with a product. It could be goods, a service, a
              company, an organization, or even a person. However, positioning
              is not what you do to a product. Rather, it refers to what you do
              to the mind of a prospect. For example, in supermarkets. What
              brand comes to your mind when you think of supermarkets?
              Personally, I think of FairPrice, Cold Storage, and Sheng Siong.
              But are you aware that in Singapore alone, there are more than
              twenty brands of supermarkets? Why is it that the supermarket
              landscape in Singapore is being dominated by these three big
              players? It all has to do with positioning.

              Through this book, Trout and Ries has described how companies are
              able to approach the minds of prospects through positioning.
              Today, it’s not required that a brand invent or discover
              something. However, a brand must be first to get into the
              prospect’s mind.
            </p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
              The authors have also stated that it is important for companies to
              know the position of their competitors. Only by doing so can
              companies come up with an effective positioning for their product
              or services.

              One good example from the book is Avis. Avis accepted that Hertz
              was the category leader when it comes to the rental car business –
              and that confronting them head-on would be pointless. What Avis
              did was admit that they were second to Hertz, with the tagline “We
              try harder”. This campaign brought about huge success to Avis
              because Avis related itself to Hertz, who is the market leader in
              the rental car business.

              The human mind can only absorb so much in a day. Once this limit
              is hit, we instinctively filter out whatever information we
              consider to be less significant or relevant to us. Because of
              this, a huge amount of information tends to be overlooked – This
              is also the reason why so many companies fail to get the message
              across.

              Therefore, being the first in any category gives you an edge over
              your competitors. It means that you have put yourself first in the
              minds of your prospects first. And it’s difficult to bring a
              company down in the first place. Imagine a ladder. Now, imagine
              Coke and Pepsi. Coke will always be at the top, and it is
              difficult for Pepsi to overtake Coke. This brings us to the next
              key takeaway.

              According to Trout and Ries, the hard way to get into a person’s
              mind is second. Second is nowhere. Thus, rather than attempting to
              fight for a position in the prospect’s mind as having the best
              product, it is better and way more effective to position yourself
              in a different niche.

            <p className="md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222]">
              For example, if the #1 fast-food restaurant has the best burgers,
              you could try positioning yourself as having the best fries
              instead. The main point is to try to stop going head to head with
              the #1 in your category, and to create your own ladder to be #1
              of. At the end of the day, this could be a better tactic in terms
              of attempting to come out on top of your competitor. Just because
              you are positioned as the best fast food restaurant serving fries
              does not mean people won’t see you as the best fast food
              restaurant in Singapore. Below are some positioning ideas that you
              can take note of when creating your own ladder.

                <strong> Size Position.</strong> A product that is smaller than
                the existing options available.
              </li>
              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                <strong> High Price Position.</strong> A new product that

              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                <strong>Low Price Position.</strong> A product that is
                low-priced. This position is useful for new brands with short
                shelf life. Giant and Value Dollar Shop tend to give the most
                value to customers, and these shops loudly position themselves
                as low-priced.
              </li>
              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                <strong>Gender Position.</strong> Some businesses appeal to
                different genders in order to attract and connect with them. For
                example, the Marlboro Cigarette was targeted to males, while
                Virginia Slims were targeted to females.
              </li>
              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                <strong>Age Position.</strong> Businesses can target the
                different age groups of potential customers. For example,
                Colgate carries many kinds of toothpaste catered to people from
                different age groups.

              Advertising and Positioning are not considered a logical debate
              with prospects. It’s a subtle seduction. Prospects won’t debate
              with the logic and the points together. However, if you create
              something completely new, use a comparison with old ones.
              Automobile inventions were named “horse-less” carriages, while
              cola became “zero-sugar” beverages. The list is endless.{" "}

              Following comparative positioning would be the classic marketing
              strategy. The power of an organization is derived from a product.
              Therefore, if you diversify with a new product, make sure to use a
              separate name of the brand. For example, Coca-Cola only has power
              because of the soda drink they sell. The company itself is merely
              a reflection of that power. Outside of the cola field, they had to
              earn their power the hard way.

              Procter and Gamble, Coca-Cola – they do it well. These companies
              have managed to create a separate brand for each product and do a
              multi-brand strategy, rather than utilizing the power of the
              successful product which is already at the top. Procter and Gamble
              sell different detergent with different brand names which makes it
              easier and cheaper for them to manage, as well as create unique
              business strategies for each brand. In the same way, Coca-Cola
              does not call its healthy version of beverage Coke Healthy,
              rather, they brand it with different names.{" "}

              To reposition a brand which is already occupying the #1 slot,
              brands need to conflict with a simple idea that changes
              perspective in consumers mind to create a void. When people
              believed the earth is flat, someone said, “No, it is round” and
              they gave simple theories for people to verify themselves. A
              person doesn’t have to be a mathematician to verify that. When an
              established product leaves a gap, competitors can talk about it
              and reposition their product as filling the gap.

              To change the positioning of your competitor, you must rather say
              something about the competitor’s product to change the customer’s

              “The objective of your advertisement should not be to communicate

              Always highlight drawbacks of the competitor’s brand – in a subtle
              way and propose the solution. That was what Tylenol did against

              The comparison must be avoided in repositioning your brand. Some
              brands failed to create impressions in customers’ minds because
              they compared themselves with other leaders and emphasized the
              points that they are best which eventually failed with a question
              in consumer’s minds, “if your brand is so better, how come it is

              Can you think of a few brands that come to your mind? Why so?
              Brand names are important as it will unconsciously hold a position
              in the prospect’s mind. Hence, it is critical to keep your brand
              name relevant. As an illustration, Kodak and Nike may seem like
              random brand names, but if you do search for what the word
              actually means, you will be able to better comprehend and relate
              to the position they want the brand to hold in your mind.

              It is also common for brands to change their names from time to
              time in order to stay relevant. They do it for broadening the
              meaning and generalizing it. For example, the Sales Management
              Department has now evolved into the Sales and Marketing Department
              to accommodate the fast-changing market needs.

              Line extension occurs when a strong brand, such as Coke, decides
              to employ the same brand name on a new product. While there are
              certain situations where line extension may come in handy / makes
              sense, more often than not, one should be wary of it.

              For instance, if you were Coke, and wanted to launch a new soft
              drink, it would only be wise not to call it Coke Juice. Line
              extension dilutes your brand. It also makes it more difficult for
              your brand to maintain a strong presence in the minds of
              prospects. Is Coke still a cola company? Or has it evolved into a
              company that produces a line of soft drinks? If things go awry, it
              is possible that the #2 in the category, in this case, Pepsi, may
              end up taking the top spot.

              #5: How to position your business in prospect’s mind

              Firstly, it is important to identify what position you already
              have in the mind of your prospect. Once you have done so, it will
              be much simpler for you to establish what position you want to
              own. It is also crucial to know who your competitors are and
              whether you have enough budget to go against your competitors.
              Lastly, sticking it out in the industry is of utmost importance.
              Positioning is a concept that is cumulative. “Whether you are
              selling colas, companies, countries, or even yourself. Out of
              mind, out of business.”

                Think outside in rather than inside out. Look into the
                prospect’s mind and find where you stand.

              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                Define yourself with a single concept ruthlessly. Avoid the too
                broad position to own. You can’t be everything to everybody.{" "}

              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Even lousy ones. Anything
                worthwhile doing is worthwhile doing lousy.{" "}

              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                Find the hole to fill. Find the position nobody owns. Don’t go
                head to head!{" "}

                It’s better to try a narrow market first before going global.
                Being #1 in Singapore is better than being #7 in Southeast Asia.

              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                Understand the words you choose for your business. Words have
                meanings and they hold pictures in mind. Every product is just a
                box without the name of the product on the box. Therefore,
                choose your name wisely. A racing car can’t be called a turtle.{" "}

              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                Don’t change for the sake of changing! It is important to hold
                your position. Rather, you can find different mediums to deliver
                your message, such as the use of technology. One good example
                would be Netflix. Although the company started as a distribution
                channel, it recently emerged as the leader for online streaming
                platforms.{" "}

              “In politics,” said John Lindsay, “the perception is the reality.”
              So, too, in advertising, in business, and in life.

              Well, before you start thinking that ‘Positioning is not relevant
              to me, I do not intend to start a business.’ I am here to tell you
              that it is possible to position yourself and your career through
              the positioning techniques we have earlier read about. Firstly,
              you have to define yourself. How do you want people to remember
              you, and what do you want them to remember you for? If you are
              able to properly define yourself, you might be able to get into
              the minds of your prospects. Next, do not be afraid to make
              mistakes! More often than not, humans learn the most by pushing
              themselves out of their comfort zones and making mistakes.
            </p>

              As stated by Trout and Ries, your reputation will probably be
              better within the company if you try many times and succeed
              sometimes than if you fear failure and only try for sure things.
              Next, it is important to make sure your name is right. Have you
              ever heard of the singer, Katy Perry? Do you know that she
              actually changed her name such that she wouldn’t be mistaken for
              another singer? Now you know the importance of names! Lastly, in
              order to succeed, it is important to try smarter. How? Find a
              horse to ride! While your pride may stop you from doing so,
              success in life is based more on what others can do for you rather
              than what you can do for yourself. Below are the six types of
              horses you can and should ride:
            </p>

            <ul className="pt-[20px] list-decimal  text-[16px] leading-[28px] ml-[40px] mb-[50px]  md:leading-[32px] md:text-[20px]">
              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                Your company – It is paramount that you know the direction of
                your company. Is this company able to provide you with growth
                opportunities? If it isn’t, my advice to you is to get a new
                company.
              </li>
              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                Your boss – Ask yourself the same questions about your boss as
                you asked yourself about the company. The goal here is to work
                for the smartest, brightest, most competent person you can find.
                Why? If your boss is going places, chances are good that you are
                too.{" "}
              </li>
              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                A friend – No, I am not referring to your personal friends.
                Rather, it is beneficial to have a large circle of business
                friends. The more business friends you make outside of your own
                organization, the more likely you are to end wind up in a big,
                rewarding job. However, do take note that it is important to
                exercise these business friendships once in a while, otherwise,
                you won’t be able to ride it when you need it! You can do so by
                asking them out for lunch once in a while, sending them articles
                that they may be interested in, as well as congratulating them
                when they achieve their goals.{" "}
              </li>
              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                An idea – We may all have had moments where we thought of a
                great idea but were reluctant to share it with others for fear
                of being ridiculed. Sometimes, people expect too much of an
                idea. In order to ride the “idea” horse, you must be willing to
                be ridiculed. You must be willing to go against the tide. Only
                by sticking your neck out and taking risks will you be able to
                be the first in coming up with a new idea or concept.{" "}
              </li>
              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                Faith – It is crucial to have faith in others and their ideas!
                Have you heard the story of Ray Kroc and the McDonald Brothers?
                From this story, the key takeaway is to believe in yourself! If
                you don’t, you are bound for failure.{" "}
              </li>
              <li className="pb-[15px]">
                Yourself – While it is possible to succeed in business or in
                life all by yourself, it’s not easy. It always takes two hands
                to clap. Take selling, for example. You don’t make a sale all by
                yourself. Somebody also has to purchase what you are selling. As
                Trout and Ries mentioned, it is important to remember that the
                winningest jockeys are not necessarily the strongest or
                lightest. The best jockey doesn’t win the race. The jockey that
                wins the race is usually the one with the best horse. Therefore,
                pick yourself a horse to ride and then ride it for all it’s
                worth.{" "}

              In a world where people heavily rely on technology, Digital
              Transformation can no longer be ignored. Especially if an
              organization wants to succeed and gain profits. With digital tools
              such as the multilingual web framework, the process of expanding
              and scaling internationally is now easier as compared to before.
              It is obvious that only businesses that fully embrace and invest
              in their digital transformation will thrive.
