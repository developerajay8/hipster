              Digital therapeutics are software-based medical treatments
              designed to prevent, manage, or treat a wide range of medical
              conditions. They use evidence-based interventions to deliver
              personalized care to patients, leveraging technology such as
              mobile apps, wearables, and other digital tools. Digital
              therapeutics can be used alone or in conjunction with traditional
              therapies to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

              How do digital therapeutics work?

            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
              Digital therapeutics work by providing patients with tailored
              interventions that help them manage their health. These
              interventions are based on a patientâ€™s medical history, lifestyle,
              and other factors that may impact their health. For example, a
              digital therapeutic for diabetes may provide patients with
              reminders to take their medication, monitor their blood sugar
              levels, and provide personalized nutrition and exercise plans.
