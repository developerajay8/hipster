              Before getting into the details of building a Minimum Viable
              product, or MVP, let us briefly look at what a Minimum Viable
              Product is and how it can help your business? As the name
              suggests, a Minimum Viable Product involves building a product
              with only the bare minimum and most essential features that many
              companies launch in the marketplace as a testing tool. It’s
              purpose is to provide primary customers with a viable product and
              in future develop it further with enhanced features to attract
              more users. Most big companies start out with an MVP and then
              slowly gain influence. The advantages of a Minimum Viable Product
              are manifold. Not only is it an affordable alternative compared to
              a full-blown product, but it also demonstrates to the company
              whether or not they should invest more in their business idea.
              Additionally, it helps develop a thoughtful product step by step.
              A common mistake while coming up with an MVP is that companies
              sometimes build an extremely crude product that doesn’t serve its
              purpose. It’s important to keep in mind that your Minimum Viable
              Product should be complete in the sense that it allows for users
              to achieve what they are looking for with easy to use and basic
              steps.

              An MVP is an observational tool. So the question you need to ask

              An MVP is an In other words, indulge in market research. So you
              get an idea that you feel is excellent. You rush to execute it as
              you think that the sheer brilliance of your idea is enough to make
              it an instant success. Is that the right way to go about it?
              Probably not. No matter how good your idea is in theory, you need
              to get a practical insight. How? By indulging in market research.
              Hold surveys, look at market trends, observe your competitors.
              These activities will help provide the comprehensive outlook you
              need before investing in a Minimum Viable Product.

              A product can not serve everyone, neither can it be completely
              useless and have no users. In order to build your MVP, you need to
              decide the audience that is most inclined towards using the
              product that you intend to launch. Do not be in a rush to
              accumulate customers, instead, focus on adding value to the target
              audience.

              Let’s suppose your idea is to provide a grooming service booking
              facility online. You have determined your primary target audience
              (middle-aged daily workers that don’t get enough time to visit the
              salon). Now you need to establish the most essential features that
              your mobile/web app will provide. Focus on only the main feature
              (s) and try to design/map out a user flow that will help the
              audience use the service in a simple manner.

              Minimum Viable Product. Sounds like a simple enough task but many
              companies overlook this step. Coming up with a mark that your MVP
              needs to cross in order for you to invest time and money in it is
              quite necessary. And once you have observed the market thoroughly,
              it is not that difficult to set a goal.

                MVP’s are the core of a lean startup- This idea is not true.
                Yes, most successful businesses fully developed their business
                with a simple, yet efficient MVP, it is not at the heart of any
                successful business. What gives shape to any business is an idea
                that fulfills an existing need.

                A minimum viable product should have all the best features-
                Nope. An MVP should have the most essential features, i.e.,
                features that serve the purpose and provide the solution without
                being excessive.

                An unsuccessful MVP implies a failed product- Although MVP’s are
                sort of a testing tool, an unsuccessful MVP does not necessarily
                mean that your business idea is not good enough. It could also
                mean that your Minimum Viable Product was designed without
                proper planning. Therefore, you should always have an efficient
                team of developers or hire the expert professionals.

              <li className="pb-4">
              Not indulging in market research- The importance of this cannot be stressed enough, market research is the first step towards building a desirable MVP. DO NOT neglect it.
              </li>
              <li  className="pb-4">
              Desiring excellence a little too fast- The lure of excellence can ruin and has ruined many MVP’s. Therefore, do not be greedy and try to incorporate all the features you feel would give your product a competitive edge or maybe an aesthetic appearance. Stay focused on building a minimum viable product, i.e., minimum resources, maximum viability.
              </li>
              <li  className="pb-4">
              Ignoring user feedback- This stage comes later on, but is extremely crucial for any business. Customers and demand are the reason businesses flourish. Ignore your customer’s feedback and someone else will satisfy them. So, be smart, and always pay attention to user feedback.
              </li>

            <p className="md:text-[20px] text-[16px]  md:leading-[32px] leading-[28px] mb-[20px]">Finally, the most common mistake is hiring inexperienced or unsuitable staff for building your MVP. The developers need to be aware of what they are doing and what your business idea is. Therefore, always hire a professional and reliable team of developers. If you feel like your on company cannot execute the task.
