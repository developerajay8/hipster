              A mobile application has a bigger role to play in the digital
              transformation of businesses than is evident on the surface. A
              well designed mobile or web app is beneficial for customers as
              well as the company. Customers can access their needs at the
              fingertips, have more faith in the company they are dealing with
              (as mobile apps are transparent with their processes), better
              organize their purchases/wish-list, and get support hassle free.

              On the other hand, businesses with a mobile application can better
              understand customer activity, collect useful information to
              implement business strategies, interact easily with their users,
              and expect a hike in customer demand. However, in order to get the
              most out of your mobile/web app, it is important that the
              application is created and designed in a way that best reflects
              your goals. It should also be user friendly and require constant
              updates and fixes (since mobile software keep evolving).
              Therefore, it becomes crucial to have your app developed by
              trusted experts.{" "}

              Last year, many businesses were struck hard with the pandemic.
              Many companies collapsed entirely, some are still struggling to
              get back on their feet, some did better than others, and some
              achieved spectacular success despite the global lockdown. The key
              to this success witnessed by businesses is digital transformation.

              A State of Digital Business Transformation research conducted in
              2018 by IDG revealed that nearly 90% of business organizations
              hold one thing in common- they either already have a digital
              strategy in place, or plan to imply it soon. In the time that has
              elapsed since, digital transformation has become an urgency
              instead of a recommendation. The time to act is now, and small
              businesses have the most to gain.

              What customers need is quick solutions. With a mobile app or a web

              indulge in transactions with your business. A well designed

              Setting up a business requires a varied range of tasks that an
              individual cannot perform on their own. But instead of hiring
              employees for every basic need, entrepreneurs can take advantage
              of many third party platforms such as WordPress (for hosting),
              Canva (for website design), and Google analytics (for analytical
              data). These platforms enable users to work on things they don’t
              necessarily have a background in. So, instead of hiring coders,
              designers, and other technical or non-technical employees that
              your small business cannot afford, either hire a trusted third
              party freelancer or have automated processes in place to help a
              smooth running of your business.

              Real estate prices are constantly moving up. As a small business,
              it is not always feasible to rent an office space. Therefore,
              having an organized remote workforce is an extremely viable option
              to save expenses while still achieving the targets. Businesses
              should consider using project management tools and have regular
              meetings or monitoring of employees on virtual platforms to ensure
              productivity.
