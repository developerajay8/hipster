              Singapore is the capital of technological innovation in Asia.
              According to the Global Innovation Index 2020 (published by WIPO,
              INSEAD & Cornell University), Singapore is among the top ten
              countries in the world when it comes to innovation. It is ranked
              at number 8, with the Republic of Korea following not far behind
              at number 10. Only two Asian countries made it to the top 10, and
              Singapore has been a common name to be included at the top in the
              GII rankings.

              In Singapore, the need for Digital Transformation among
              businesses, especially SME’s has become an imminent need of the
              hour. While most companies already have the basic processes of
              Digital transformation in place, others are embracing it as we
              speak. The top technological trends that companies in Singapore
              should be prepared for in 2024 have been discussed below.

              Technological innovations are recreating the way we think,
              organize, and strategize. Technological trends can be used to
              revolutionize work-places and their operations. The trends
              mentioned below will have a huge impact on companies not only in
              Singapore, but all across the world as they learn to embrace them.

              The top 2024 technology trends in Singapore are focused on
              revamping the legacy systems of any corporation, which includes
              software, hardware, networking or operating systems that a firm
              continuously puts to use in order to reduce costs. Legacy systems
              are usually kept in use because they often form the core of an
              enterprise’s processes. However, since these are old, most legacy
              systems cannot be upgraded or made more secure. Since these are
              core systems, it is important for companies to keep them safe from
              security breaches and other breakdowns. Core revival refers to the
              modernization of legacy enterprise systems which involves moving a
              system from an industry-specific platform to a secure cloud-based
              one. To many, this can be costly but companies in Singapore have
              been overcoming this hurdle by outsourcing or shifting their
              legacy values to powerful platforms which allow for less coding by
              businesses. It won’t be long before this trend becomes common and
              businesses start to reap more benefits and add more value to their
              core systems.

                Artificial intelligence involves the use of smart machines to
                imitate human thought and behaviour. According to a news release
                published by Accenture in 2017, the use of AI in Singapore can
                generate a gross value of nearly 215 billion USD by 2035.
                Business services, manufacturing, and financial services will
                reap the highest benefits by employing AI processes and machines
                into their framework. A total of 11 industry sectors will profit
                immensely if AI is used in their digital transformation plans.
                Education, Health & Social Services, IT, Transportation are some
                other industry sectors that follow close behind the top 3
                mentioned earlier. With the prominent possibilities of growth
                that AI possesses, the country has already launched a program:
                AI SG (AI Singapore) with funding of upto 150 million USD to
                accelerate, cooperte, and boost AI’s capabilities in the
                country’s economy.

                A distributed cloud system is one in which each node (server) is
                independent but grouped together so that they provide data to an
                application as and when required. Distributed cloud computing is
                a new way of handling computing services, where you can move
                certain processes from your own premises to centralized clouds,
                such as AWS or GCP. The most common use cases for distributed
                cloud computing include- infrastructural development, process
                outsourcing, and data privacy protection.
