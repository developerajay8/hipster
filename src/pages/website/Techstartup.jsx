              Reading Adam Grant’s new book Think Again, one is made to question
              and analyze their own beliefs and perceptions. We found that the
              ideas and quotes shared in the book hold a lot of relevance in
              today’s fast evolving world of technology and that every
              entrepreneur should give it a read and ponder upon for their
              businesses. Entrepreneurs and working professionals are bound to
              be moved by the importance and power of rethinking and rethinking
              creates Blue Oceans in businesses and rethinking also creates new
              innovation in technology.

              It is easy for us to lean towards ways of thinking and doing
              things that align with our comfort. However, the world is
              constantly evolving. In order to be truly successful one has to
              keep an open mindset. An open mindset that has the ability to
              unlearn. In the world of technology, new inventions and processes
              are sprouting every year. Companies want to stick with what has
              worked for them. At one point, the technology, or perhaps the lack
              of it- becomes outdated. One is forced to move to new ways of
              doing things. The power of rethinking makes that transition from
              one step to another a voluntary one, instead of being forced.

              Advancements in technology are an everyday affair. From the
              up-gradation of mobile devices and software tools to the use of
              Artificial Intelligence- as businesses we are faced with new
              technologies every year and have to make a decision keeping our
              best interests in mind. For any technology improving with newer
              versions, for technologies where they were relevant 10 years back
              they are no longer relevant now. However, in most cases we follow
              the herd without rethinking our choices. Or even worse, we stick
              with the technology and processes that are established in our
              workspace simply because it’s easier. The power of rethinking can
              help us succeed in every walk of our life, be it business or
              personal. Emotional and intellectual intelligence are developed by
              keeping a mindset that has the ability to question its own
              thoughts and take disagreement in a positive manner.

              Adam Grant’s Think Again is a reflection of how as social beings
              we can keep evolving in all walks of life. We have compiled a list

              “If you don’t look back at yourself and think. Wow, how stupid I
              was a year ago, then you must not have learned much in the last
              year.”

              We’ve all had this thought at least once in our lives. Whether
              it’s your taste in music, dressing style, or choices you’ve made
              before; at one point in your life you look back and feel
              embarrassed. However, this is something that teaches us that we’ve
              grown over the years. A higher frequency of this type of thinking
              denotes that we’re learning new things and broadening our mindsets
              with time. In terms of business and technology, a company’s growth
              is directly proportional to constant up-dation in terms of
              processes employed. Therefore, one should always have the ability
              to look back and see their shortcomings while incorporating new
              trends and ways of thinking.

              When you read a study that surprises you, how do you react? Many
              people would get defensive, searching for flaws in the study’s
              design or the statistical analysis. Danny did the opposite. His
              eyes lit up, and a huge grin appeared on his face. “That was
              wonderful,” he said. “I was wrong.”

              This quote highlights the usual norm of trying to look for flaws
              in studies that do not support our own thinking. What it’s trying
              to teach us is that instead of looking for ways to defend our own
              beliefs, one should feel more educated and profound while grasping
              ideas that contradict our own and getting a new perspective on
              things.

              Truer words have not been spoken. Someone that is ignorant towards
              the changes in technology and perceptions in the world is
              aggressively confident about the cocoon of ideas that they wrap
              themselves in. A person who is always eager to learn, will

              Throughout history we have seen ideologies being dismantled and
              established beliefs being usurped. It teaches us that the world
              and its principles are constantly evolving. Codes of morality,
              societal roles, gender structures, etc. are changing. There used
              to be a time when same-sex relationships were considered an
              unforgivable sin. However, LGBTQ relationships are steadily being
              supported and accepted now. The people who do not have the ability
              to unlearn what they have been taught previously, will never be
              capable of learning new things. They will be branded as outdated,
              hypocritical, and foolishly ignorant.

              We often surround ourselves with people that agree with us and
              affirm our opinions. Those who disagree with us, we tend to avoid
              or distance ourselves from. However, true knowledge is gained when
              someone challenges our ways of thinking and confronts us with a
              different opinion. Whereas the people who agree with us at all
              times, are only giving us validation to please our ego. They have
              nothing new to teach us. Entrepreneurs have a lot to learn from
              this quote. It is not necessary to favour the employees that
              always agree with you. The ones that are bold enough to express
              their own opinions that are different from yours, should be
              cherished and respected as you can truly learn from them.

              When faced with the option of choosing between what’s easy and
              what’s right, we often make the mistake of picking what’s easy.
              It’s easy to stick with an outdated software that still functions
              than learning about a new one and getting it installed,
              irrespective of whether or not the new software is better. This is
              just an example and the quote can be applied to a broad range of
              circumstances. However, the bottom line is that making the choice
              of doing the right thing requires effort, which many of us are
              simply lazy to put in.
