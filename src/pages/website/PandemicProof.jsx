              Covid 19 has had a huge impact on most economies across the globe.
              2020 brought forward the biggest economic recession that Singapore
              has witnessed in a decade. Although the brunt of this recession
              was not borne equally by all industry sectors, it is safe to say
              that most small and medium enterprises struggled to keep their
              business from suffering irreversible losses. The pandemic will

                fix the gaps and prepare better for them to continue being

                sectors in the same way, in a business there are always core
                functionalities that are more prone to risk. It is the job of

              implications of Covid 19 on businesses, only the companies that
              had scaled the use of Digital technologies into their organization
              were able to fight off the negative impact of Covid 19. 2020 was a
              huge wake up call for companies who have not yet begun their
              processes of Digital transformation or were in the initial stages
              of it. We don’t need reports to tell us that recovery will be
              digital, especially when the pandemic calls for social distancing
              and avoiding close physical interaction. We know that the recovery
              will be digital, and an excellent way to mitigate the risk of

              The recent pandemic forced many offices to shut down and

              companies should ensure that they have the right infrastructure.

              The first step is to review the existing technology you own and
              put to use. Is it up to date? Are the employees finding it easy to

              sufficient to carry out all tasks methodically. Any opportunity
              for additions/replacements in the IT infrastructure that will help
              facilitate important processes, should not be missed. The focus

              Everyday tasks that are performed on a regular basis should be
              optimised with the use of right technology and tools. One needs to
              weed out the repetitive time consuming tasks and convert them into
              easy and effective automated processes. Automation is a great way
              to optimize the workflow in any company. Priority should be given
              to the tasks that add the highest value, but automation should
              also gradually shift to cover all processes.

            This does not mean complete shutdown of office locations. Despite the relaxation in restriction of travel and social distancing norms, companies need to evaluate which processes require the most attention to avoid losses, and figure out a way to keep those processes running effectively while employees work from home. Employees should have the resources to work and report in a manner that ensures their safety and the productivity of the company.

            <p  className=" md:text-[20px] text-[16px] md:leading-[32px] leading-[28px] mb-[20px]">Team leaders and management personnel should employ work reporting and tracking softwares.

Therefore, commitment to following safety measures and not pressurizing the employees to the point of break-down is important. It is only when the employees of a certain business stay healthy and work productively, that a company can make the best of their resources. Therefore, employees should be made aware that their company cares for their safety.</p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] text-[16px] md:leading-[32px] leading-[28px] mb-[20px]">In Singapore, as well as around the globe, it is the hospitality and tourism industry that has been most impacted by the pandemic. Although these businesses are getting back on their feet with the pandemic receding, it is a slow process. The tourism and hospitality sectors must prioritize sanitization and health safety measures to lure its customers back. However, most people still don’t feel comfortable dining out or making travel plans. But the silver lining is, most people are also fed up with the restrictions put forward by the pandemic. Once all these restrictions are uplifted and people start to feel safe, these industries are bound to witness a surge in the demand of their services. Most people are craving to sit in a restaurant and enjoy their favorite cuisine, and go to their favorite holiday destinations.</p>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] text-[16px] md:leading-[32px] leading-[28px] mb-[20px]">In conclusion, what would really make businesses immune to the negative impacts of the recent and any future pandemic, is preparedness. Having a well thought-out risk management plan that works, and holding the proper digital technologies that help execute this plan, is what makes businesses pandemic proof in 2021.</p>
