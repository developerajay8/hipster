            Millennials have more than 67 apps installed over the phone, however, the number of the commonly used app remains just 25 (Simform’s study). Therefore, the question arises why some apps attract more engagement as compared to others. The mobile app ecosystem is getting more competitive each day. It has become additionally challenging to create a mobile app that stands out from others, is interesting for users and has a long shelf life.There are various ways to achieve this. Incorporating methods like- in -product customer reviews, personalised accounts, social media management, giveaways, etc. are a few ways to make your application unique and interactive.

            Another possible strategy would be the gamification of your app. Gamification is a power tool used by designers to insert gameplay elements in non-gaming settings to increase user engagement with a product or service. By weaving fun features into the app, the designers tap users’ intrinsic motivations so they enjoy using it more.

              The last statistic mentioned above states that 92% of time spent on mobile devices is via an app. While many companies might struggle with picking between a mobile application and having a responsive website, it is really not a difficult decision.

              A responsive website would be a website that users can browse and navigate through on their mobile devices without missing out any features as compared to a desktop user. Having a mobile responsive website is quite important, but a mobile application has some added benefits.

              The advantages and reasons of having a mobile application developed for your business will be discussed in detail further in the article. A responsive website is common among businesses with an online presence these days. It is cheaper and easier to come up with when compared to a mobile application. However, one cannot use a responsive website as a substitute for a mobile application.

              Change is the only thing that’s permanent. Gone are the days when Mobile apps and digital transformation of businesses were a thing of the future. The recent pandemic has made online business transactions skyrocket in several economic industries. It is the responsibility of all businesses, no matter how big or small, to align their practices with market trends. Here’s a list of advantages that a mobile app can have for your business:

            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            Entertaining your users is an excellent way to keep them on your app. Many mobile apps related to educational and skill-learning purposes that help people learn coding, math, music, language do so by making their app’s interface more appealing and interactive. If your app is enjoyable and entertaining it will motivate the users to explore it more. Even the simplest app with some gaming interaction will seem more exciting.

            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            A loyalty program consists of rewarding the user for using your app. It is an effective way to gamify your app. Rewarding users for frequently accessing your app, achieving goals, buying goods, sharing posts with their friends, participating in competitions and quizzes, and inviting friends to join the app will encourage them to keep returning to your app and grow their interest constantly. Unlike offering useless prizes, offer a reward that has an intrinsic value for the user, for example- in-app currency for spending within the app, cash rewards and digital goods to be exchanged for real goods. Identify what makes users come back to your app again and again, and offer it to them.

            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            Tap into the social component of your audience and introduce competition as a gaming element to your app. Badges or points can be used to denote achievements and users can be ranked according to it, therefore, they will remain more engaged due to their urge to win.This will help users to share achievements easily, which adds to their feel-good factor. A lot of fitness apps use this technique where users can challenge their friends or even connect with other users who are using the same app.

            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            People have a need for recognition and want to keep a track of their status. A progress display motivates your users to level up and not quit. Whether it is learning a new skill or following a fitness program, program display is a great way to retain users and support them throughout their journey. Once they have accomplished a certain lever, allow them to share the news with the entire globe. This will make people post on social platforms and share their stories with others. It is an effective way for business promotion.

            A leaderboard will allow your user to compare their progress with others and at the same time induce competition. This makes users more interested and tempted to stay engaged as players so that they can actively become a part of the race and prove themselves to be winners. They will want to achieve the highest score and acquire the first place, thus, offering your users a chance to compete with their friends, to get them engaged with your mobile application and grow your app’s network.

            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            Consider social media looping into your app to allow users to show off their skills and achievements on social media platforms. This flaunting nature of your user will not only help to retain existing customers but also acquire new ones and create an awareness about your app. Make sure to add an option for your existing user to invite their friends who are not using your app, this helps to gamify your app in a profitable way.

            Humans desire self-expression and a developer can address this desire by incorporating certain features in the mobile app. Allow users to express themselves with avatars, badges and through any other virtual goods. The simplest example of app gamification technique that appeals to self expression is allowing the user to personalize their profile page on your app. Understanding your customer and your product will be a more effective way to implement this technique.

            It is important to note that while gamification is a useful tool, it is also necessary to implement a strategy that will help you reap optimum benefits . Many times you will notice that not all incentive techniques work with some apps. If you integrate the above features without understanding how it connects with your user, your efforts to gamify your app is futile.To tackle this issue, here are some points to keep in mind to set up a successful mobile app gamification strategy-
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc ml-[22px] leading-[27px] mt-[20px] text-[20px] text-[#222222] font-poppins">
              <li>Decide your target audience</li>
              <li>Find something of value for your target audience and use it in your app</li>
              <li>Figure out what suits your app best and build techniques that are well ingrained in the ecosystem</li>
              <li>Keep it simple for users to engage</li>
              <li>Quick rewards will keep the users entertained and motivate them to achieve goals</li>
              <li>Encourage and monitor user feedback</li>
              <li>Integrate social media platform into your app</li>
            </ul>
            <p className=" md:text-[20px] taxt-[16px] leading-[28px] md:leading-[32px] text-[#222] mt-[20px]">
            Gamification works more effectively when the users are already a part of the ecosystem and are engaged with your app. It is an excellent solution to the most burning challenge of customer retention. It is a crucial marketing tactic based on human psychology used to change user’s experience to motivate them to interact with your app more frequently, thus delivering a desired behaviour towards your product. This enhances the popularity of your mobile app in the market and generates more revenue.
